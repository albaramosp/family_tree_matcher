Family Tree Matcher documentation
===================================

**Family Tree Matcher** is a Python API that finds lost ancestors of the pople
who register in our database!   It is my attempt to play with TDD, hexagonal architecture,
sphinx, FAstAPI and all the stuff that comes across my mind.
Check out the :doc:`usage` section to begin playing with the API!

.. note::

   This project is under active development and you won't really find your ancestors
